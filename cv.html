          I have strong experience with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, Linux &amp; Bash. My current and past roles have also involved desktop &amp; mobile browser testing, responsive website builds, Prototype/MVP builds with new APIs and/or languages, AWS website &amp; service creation and maintenance (EC2, RDS, S3, Route 53, Lambda), server and website security testing and maintenance
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy experimenting with new langauges and platforms and looking for opportunities to build a product with them. I've recently started using React and would really like to continue my Python training as that will be key for future Data Science (and Machine learning) goals.
